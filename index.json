By the end of the course, students will have a basic understanding of cybersecurity concepts and be better equipped to protect themselves and their organizations from cyber threats.\nStudy guides:\n2022-2023 2021-2022 2020-2021 ","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1761179431,"objectID":"7bb092ab0a5845cafa1c68bdd64d74e7","permalink":"/teaching/introduction-to-cyber-security/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/teaching/introduction-to-cyber-security/","section":"teaching","summary":"Introduction to Cyber Security is a course designed to provide students with a fundamental understanding of cybersecurity.
