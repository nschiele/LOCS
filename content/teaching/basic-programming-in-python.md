Basic Programming in Python is a course designed to provide students with a foundational understanding of Python programming language. The course is intended for mostly non-technical students who are interested in learning programming in Python. Students will learn the basic syntax, data structures, and control flow constructs of the Python programming language. The course will cover topics such as variables, data types, operators, conditional statements, loops, functions, and file I/O. Through hands-on coding exercises, students will learn how to write simple Python programs to solve real-world problems. By the end of the course, students will have an understanding of Python programming and be able to write simple Python programs on their own.
