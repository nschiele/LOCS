Whereas in modules Measures and Interventions and Network Security of the technical track attention was paid to the characteristics of ICT systems, types of attacks and possible security measures, the main aim of this course is that students translate and apply their theoretical/technical knowledge in specific case studies. Case studies will be related to mobile system security, SOC operations and security monitoring, threat modelling, data integrity in the cloud, and blockchain technology. Participants will design a security architecture and analyse a system for the chosen case. They should write a primarily technical report, taking non-technical aspects and possible impact into account. In addition to the report the students should give a presentation for both staff and their colleagues.
