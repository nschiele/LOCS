In spite of all efforts to improve software security, vulnerabilities are still distributed in software. While producing secure software, there are problems with not only purely technical practices but also non-technical practices, such as organizational, behavioral, and governance aspects. People, who make decisions have less understanding of non-technical practices. In this project, you will explore which non-technical practices are involved in the secure software methodologies and the methods used to provide evidence of the effectiveness of these practices.
