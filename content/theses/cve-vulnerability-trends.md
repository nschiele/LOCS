We want to understand, measure, and prove why we have more CVEs each year. Are we finding more CVEs? Do we write less secure code? Or is it just too much software?

This thesis requires critical thinking and sufficient background in data science to analyze vulnerability trends, correlate them with software development metrics, and determine the root causes of the increasing number of CVEs reported annually.
