However, recently it has been reported that some of these exploits are being weaponized, i.e., they attack the system on which the pentest is conducted.", "In this work we analyze the exploit landscape on GitHub over the last 5 years. We have proposed several heuristics to identify weaponized (malicious) exploits. Although we cannot detect all malicious exploits with these heuristics, our evaluation shows that weaponized exploits are widely distributed, and that the security community must be extra careful when reusing the proof-of-concept code from unknown sources."],
